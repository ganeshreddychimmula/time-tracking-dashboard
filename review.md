# Review 1 - CUBE CSS Alignment in Your Project

---

## 1. Alignment with CUBE CSS Principles

### Class Names, Objects, and Utilities
- **Composition (`c-`)**: You use `.c-dashboard`, `.c-profile-card`, `.c-view-selector`, `.c-activity-card`, etc. in `index.html` and `composition.css`. These are clear, consistent, and well-scoped for layout and structure.
- **Utility (`u-`)**: Utilities like `.u-flex`, `.u-text-preset-3`, `.u-border-radius-standard`, etc. are used extensively and correctly for single-purpose styling (`utility.css`). These are applied directly in the markup, as CUBE recommends.
- **Block**: Block-level classes like `.profile-card`, `.activity-card`, `.activity-card-wrapper` are present and used for component styling (`block.css`). These are generally well-structured.
- **Exception**: `exception.css` handles one-off or contextual tweaks (e.g., coloring cards by `data-cardtype`, state styling for `[data-state="active"]`). This is a good use of the Exception layer.

### State Layer
- State is managed via `data-state` attributes (e.g., for active timeframe), and styled in the Exception layer. This is a CUBE-aligned approach.

## 2. Structure of Utility, Object, and State Layers

- **Utilities** are separated into their own file and not mixed with block/object styles.
- **Objects/Blocks** are in `block.css`, and not overloaded with utility rules.
- **State** is handled via data attributes and styled in `exception.css`, not by toggling classes in JS (good separation).

---

## 3. Major Deviations

- **No major deviations** from CUBE CSS. Your structure is modular, and you avoid mixing concerns.
- **JS and CSS separation**: Your JS only manipulates state/data attributes, not presentational classes, which is correct for CUBE.

**Impact:**  
No serious issues for maintainability or scalability. Your approach is robust and will scale well.

---

## 4. Minor Inconsistencies & Opportunities

- **Utility + Block Mixing**: In your markup, you sometimes stack many utilities and block classes (e.g., `<aside class="c-profile-card u-flex u-flex-column u-border-radius-standard profile-card">`). While this is not wrong, consider if some utilities (like flex layouts) could be moved into the block/object layer if always present for that component.
- **Redundant Classes**: Some elements have both `c-` and non-prefixed block classes (e.g., `c-profile-card profile-card`). Consider standardizing on one naming convention per layer.
- **Unused Utility Class**: The `.active` class in `utility.css` is not used, as you rely on `[data-state="active"]` (which is better). You can remove `.active` for clarity.
- **JS Comments**: In your JS, you have commented-out class toggling (`// button.classList.add("active");`). This is not needed and could be removed for clarity.

## 5. Overall Assessment

- **Direction**: You are applying CUBE CSS methodology correctly and thoughtfully. Your separation of composition, utility, block, and exception layers is clear and effective.
- **No Fundamental Misunderstandings**: You demonstrate a solid grasp of CUBE CSS. The use of data attributes for state, clear utility classes, and separation of concerns is exemplary.
- **Opportunities**: As your project grows, continue to review where utilities are used repeatedly on the same block—if so, consider moving those styles into the block/object layer for DRYness.

## Summary Table

| Layer         | Implementation Quality | Notes                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Composition   | ✅ Excellent          | Clear, well-scoped, and separated                                     |
| Utility       | ✅ Excellent          | Single-purpose, well-named, not mixed with blocks                     |
| Block/Object  | ✅ Good               | Consider consolidating repeated utilities into block styles if needed |
| Exception     | ✅ Excellent          | Used for state and one-off tweaks, not overused                       |
| State         | ✅ Excellent          | Managed via data attributes, not classes                              |

## Final Verdict

**You are applying CUBE CSS in the right direction and at a high standard.**  
No fundamental misunderstandings. Just minor opportunities for further refinement as your project grows. Keep up the good work!
